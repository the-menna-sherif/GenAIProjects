1- Trying to install the requirements threw below error:
C:\Users\msherif\PycharmProjects\GenAIProjects\PromptPlayround> pip install -r .\requirements.txt 
Fatal error in launcher: Unable to create process using 
'"C:\Users\msherif\PycharmProjects\PromptPlayround\.venv\Scripts\python.exe" 
"C:\Users\msherif\PycharmProjects\GenAIProjects\PromptPlayround\.venv\Scripts\pip.exe" 
install -r .\requirements.txt': The system cannot find the file specified.

Checked the filestructure:
(.venv) PS C:\Users\msherif\PycharmProjects\GenAIProjects\PromptPlayround> ls 
Directory: C:\Users\msherif\PycharmProjects\GenAIProjects\PromptPlayround 
Mode LastWriteTime Length Name

-a---- 12/29/2025 2:13 PM 0 README.md 
-a---- 1/1/2026 1:04 PM 16 requirements.txt

Checked online and found that messing around with project path leads to breaking the virtual environment. 
.venv was created in one location, but pip.exe still points to the old/moved location...
Fix: 
Deleted .venv Directory from Explorer > Recreate it > Activate it > Upgrade pip > Rerun install command
Upgrade pip command: python -m pip install --upgrade pip

2- Failure in Git sync. The file size was too large. "Writing objects: 1.59 GiB" is the giveaway. Standard Git (and GitHub) is not designed to handle single pushes or files in the gigabyte range

Culprit was found: entire machine learning model weights (like pytorch_model.bin and model.safetensors).
Added a .gitignore with:
**/Models/
**/*.bin
**/*.safetensors
